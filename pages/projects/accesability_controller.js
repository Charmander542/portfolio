              <p className="text-[1.3rem] font-medium mb-4">
              This project developed an accessibility controller utilizing the RP240 chip it was designed and fabricated in 24 hours for a school hackathon. It integrates a diverse array 
              of sensors, such as touch, vibration, sound, and heart rate monitors, to cater to the nuanced needs of individuals with 
              limited mobility. Central to its design is the concept of customization; users can personalize the controller by adding 
              sensors that best suit their specific requirements. 
              </p>
              <p className="text-[1.3rem] font-medium mb-4">
              The design is mounted to a Logitech controller, chosen for its ergonomic design and compatibility with various controller 
              programs. The mount is designed to ensure a secure fit and easy access to the controller&apos;s functions. It features dedicated 
              slots for each sensor, allowing them to be securely attached and positioned for optimal performance. The mount&apos;s design 
              also takes into account the need for easy installation and removal of sensors, facilitating maintenance and upgrades. 
              This thoughtful design ensures that the controller maintains its comfort and functionality while expanding its capabilities
               with the added sensors.</p>

            <p className="text-[1.3rem] font-medium">
            In the software framework of our advanced accessibility controller, the TinyUSB library configures the device as a 
            USB Human Interface Device (HID), enabling effective communication with the host computer. Leveraging the dual-core 
            capability of the RP240 chip, one core is dedicated to USB host functions for efficient processing, while the other 
            manages sensor data and user inputs, ensuring smooth operation. The code includes HID callback functions to handle the 
            connection and disconnection of the HID device, alongside a filter_report() function for processing gamepad data, which 
            is crucial for interpreting inputs like joystick movements and button presses. Additionally, detailed gamepad button state 
            definitions ensure precise detection and processing of each input, enhancing the controller&apos;s responsiveness and user control.

              <p className="text-[1.3rem] font-medium mb-4">
              One of the primary challenges in this project was the integration and mounting of the various sensors onto the 
              accessibility controller. To address this, a custom part was designed and 3D printed, made to fit onto the controller. 
              This innovative approach allowed for a seamless and secure mounting of all sensors â€” including touch, vibration, sound, 
              and heart rate monitor. The 3D printed component ensured that each sensor was accurately positioned for optimal 
              functionality.
              </p>
              <p className="text-[1.3rem] font-medium mb-4">
              Another significant challenge involved the development of a custom USB controller interface. 
              The controller needed to operate in a dual mode: one for sending data from the sensors to the processing unit, 
              and another for receiving input commands. To achieve this, a bit-banged USB controller was developed. This custom 
              solution emulated the functionality of two USB controllers within a single framework, managing the bidirectional flow 
              of data. The implementation of this bit-banged USB controller was crucial for the seamless operation of the device, 
              ensuring that the data from sensors could be accurately processed while simultaneously receiving user inputs. </p>
